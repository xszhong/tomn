<TIMEX2 val="P9Y" anchor_val="1955" anchor_dir="STARTING">Diem era</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1955">1955</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1963">1963</TIMEX2>

The Geneva Accords, concluded between France and the Viet Minh in <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2>, partitioned Vietnam pending national elections (under international supervision) to be held by <TIMEX2 val="1956-07-20">20 July 1956</TIMEX2>. Much as in Korea, the agreement stipulated that the two military zones were to be separated by a temporary demarcation line (known as the Demilitarized Zone or DMZ). In <TIMEX2 val="1955-06">June 1955</TIMEX2>, Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem of the State of Vietnam (South Vietnam) announced that elections would not be held. South Vietnam had rejected the agreement from the beginning and was therefore not bound by it, he said. "How can we expect 'free elections' to be held in the Communist North?" Diem asked. President Dwight D. Eisenhower echoed senior U.S. experts  when he wrote that, in <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2>, "80 per cent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh" over Emperor Bao Dai.
The Domino Theory, which argued that if one country fell to communist forces, then all of the surrounding countries would follow, was first proposed as policy by the Eisenhower administration. It was, and is still, commonly hypothesized that it applied to Vietnam. John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. senator, said in a speech to the American Friends of Vietnam: "Burma, Thailand, India, Japan, the Philippines and obviously Laos and Cambodia are among those whose security would be threatened if the Red Tide of Communism overflowed into Vietnam."

Rule

Ngo Dinh Diem was named premier of South Vietnam in <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2> by <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1954" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> emperor and Head of State Bao Dai. A devout Roman Catholic, he was fervently anti-communist and was "untainted" by any connection to the French. He was one of the few prominent Vietnamese nationalists who could claim both attributes. Historian Luu Doan Huynh notes, however, that "Diem represented narrow and extremist nationalism coupled with autocracy and nepotism."
Robert McNamara wrote that the new American patrons were almost completely ignorant of Vietnamese culture. They knew little of the language or long history of the country. There was a tendency to assign American motives to Vietnamese actions, and Diem warned that it was an illusion to believe that blindly copying Western methods would solve Vietnamese problems.
In <TIMEX2 val="1955-04">April</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1955-06">June 1955</TIMEX2>, Diem (against U.S. advice) cleared the decks of any political opposition by launching military operations against the Cao Dai religious sect, the Hoa Hao sect, and the Binh Xuyen organized crime group (which was allied with members of the secret police and some military elements). As broad-based opposition to his harsh tactics mounted, Diem increasingly sought to blame the communists.
Beginning in <TIMEX2 val="1955-SU">the summer of 1955</TIMEX2>, he launched the "Denounce the Communists" campaign, during which communists and other anti-government elements were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or executed. Diem instituted a policy of death penalty against any activity deemed communist in <TIMEX2 val="1956-08">August 1956</TIMEX2>. Opponents were labeled Viet Cong ("Vietnamese communist") by the regime to degrade their nationalist credentials. During <TIMEX2>this period</TIMEX2> refugees moved across the demarcation line in both directions. Around 52,000 Vietnamese civilians moved from south to north. However, 800,000 people fled north Vietnam to the south, mostly in aircraft and ships provided by France and the U.S. CIA propaganda efforts increased the outflow with slogans such as "the Virgin Mary is going South." The northern, mainly Catholic refugees were meant to give Diem a strong anti-communist constituency. Diem later went on to staff his administration's key posts mostly with northern and central Catholics. As a measure of the level of political repression, about 12,000 suspected opponents of Diem were killed in <TIMEX2 val="1955">the years 1955</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1957">1957</TIMEX2> and by <TIMEX2 val="1958" mod="END">the end of 1958</TIMEX2> an estimated 40,000 political prisoners had been jailed.
In a referendum on <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" anchor_val="1955" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the future of the monarchy</TIMEX2>, Diem rigged the poll supervised by his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu and was accredited with 98.2 percent of the vote, including 133% in Saigon. His American advisers had recommended a more modest winning margin of "60 to 70 percent." Diem, however, viewed the election as a test of authority. On <TIMEX2 val="1955-10-26">26 October 1955</TIMEX2>, Diem declared the new Republic of Vietnam, with himself as president. The Republic of Vietnam was created largely because of the Eisenhower administration's desire for an anti-communist state in the region.
As a wealthy Catholic, Diem was viewed by many ordinary Vietnamese as part of the old elite who had helped the French rule Vietnam. The majority of Vietnamese people were Buddhist, so his attack on the Buddhist community served only to deepen mistrust.
In <TIMEX2 val="1956-05">May</TIMEX2>, Diem undertook a <TIMEX2 val="P10D" anchor_val="1955-05" anchor_dir="WITHIN">ten-day</TIMEX2> state visit to the United States. President Eisenhower pledged his continued support. A parade in New York City was held in his honor. Although Diem was openly praised, in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that he had been selected because there were no better alternatives.

Insurgency in the South, <TIMEX2 val="1956">1956</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1960">1960</TIMEX2>

The Sino-Soviet split led to a reduction in the influence of PRC, which had insisted in <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2> that the Viet Minh accept a division of the country. Trường Chinh, North Vietnam's pro-PRC party first secretary, was demoted and Hanoi authorized communists in South Vietnam to begin a low level insurgency in <TIMEX2 val="1956-12">December 1956</TIMEX2>. This insurgency in the south had begun in response to Diem's Denunciation of Communists campaign, in which thousands of local Viet Minh cadres and supporters had been executed or sent to concentration camps, and was in violation of the Northern Communist party line which had enjoined them not to start an insurrection, but rather engage in a political campaign, agitating for a free all-Vietnam election in accordance with the Geneva accords.
Ho Chi Minh stated, "Do not engage in military operations; that will lead to defeat. Do not take land from a peasant. Emphasize nationalism rather than communism. Do not antagonize anyone if you can avoid it. Be selective in your violence. If an assassination is necessary, use a knife, not a rifle or grenade. It is too easy to kill innocent bystanders with guns and bombs, and accidental killing of the innocent bystanders will alienate peasants from the revolution. Once an assassination has taken place, make sure peasants know why the killing occurred." This strategy was referred to as "armed propaganda."
Soon afterward, Lê Duẩn, a communist leader who had been working in the South, returned to Hanoi to accept the position of acting first secretary, effectively replacing Trường. Duẩn urged a military line and advocated increased assistance to the insurgency. Four hundred government officials were assassinated in <TIMEX2 val="1957">1957</TIMEX2> alone, and the violence gradually increased. While the terror was originally aimed at local government officials, it soon broadened to include other symbols of the status quo, such as schoolteachers, health workers, and agricultural officials.
According to one estimate, 20 percent of South Vietnam's village chiefs had been assassinated by the insurgents by <TIMEX2 val="1958">1958</TIMEX2>. (The village chiefs were Diem appointees from outside the villages and were hated by the peasantry for their corruption and abuse.) The insurgency sought to completely destroy government control in South Vietnam's rural villages and replace it with a shadow government.
In <TIMEX2 val="1959-01">January 1959</TIMEX2>, the North's Central Committee issued a secret resolution authorizing an "armed struggle". This authorized the southern communists to begin large-scale operations against the South Vietnamese military. North Vietnam supplied troops and supplies in earnest, and the infiltration of men and weapons from the north began along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In <TIMEX2 val="1959-05">May</TIMEX2>, South Vietnam enacted Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.
Observing the increasing unpopularity of the Diem regime, on <TIMEX2 val="1960-12-12">12 December 1960</TIMEX2>, Hanoi authorized the creation of the National Liberation Front as a common front controlled by the communist party in the South.
Successive American administrations, as Robert McNamara and others have noted, overestimated the control that Hanoi had over the NLF. Diem's paranoia, repression, and incompetence progressively angered large segments of the population of South Vietnam. According to a <TIMEX2 val="1960-11">November 1960</TIMEX2> report by the head of the US military advisory team, Lieutenant General Lionel C. McGarr, a "significant part" of the population in the south supported the communists. The communists thus had a degree of popular support for their campaign to bring down Diem and reunify the country.

During John F. Kennedy's administration, <TIMEX2 val="1960">1960</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1963">1963</TIMEX2>

When John F. Kennedy won the <TIMEX2 val="1960">1960</TIMEX2> U.S. presidential election, one major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U.S. As Kennedy took over, despite warnings from Eisenhower about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America "loomed larger than Asia on his sights." In his inaugural address, Kennedy made the ambitious pledge to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty."
In <TIMEX2 val="1961-06">June 1961</TIMEX2>, John F. Kennedy bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev when they met in Vienna over key U.S.-Soviet issues. The Legacy of the Korean War created the idea of a limited war.
Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using special forces for counterinsurgency warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the Green Berets would be effective in a "brush fire" war in Vietnam.
The Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In <TIMEX2 val="1961">1961</TIMEX2>, the USA had 50,000 troops based in Korea, and Kennedy faced a three-part crisis-the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the construction of the Berlin Wall, and a negotiated settlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement These made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy determined to "draw a line in the sand" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam, saying, "<TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" anchor_val="1961" anchor_dir="AS_OF">Now</TIMEX2> we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place," to James Reston of The New York Times immediately after meeting Khrushchev in Vienna.
In <TIMEX2 val="1961-05">May 1961</TIMEX2>, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diem the "Winston Churchill of Asia." Asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, "Diem's the only boy we got out there." Johnson assured Diem of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.
Kennedy's policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that "to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF">today</TIMEX2>, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences."
The quality of the South Vietnamese military, however, remained poor. Bad leadership, corruption, and political interference all played a part in emasculating the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the NLF played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.
Kennedy advisers Maxwell Taylor and Walt Rostow recommended that U.S. troops be sent to South Vietnam disguised as flood relief workers. Kennedy rejected the idea but increased military assistance yet again. In <TIMEX2 val="1962-04">April 1962</TIMEX2>, John Kenneth Galbraith warned Kennedy of the "danger we shall replace the French as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did." By <TIMEX2 val="1963">1963</TIMEX2>, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.
The Strategic Hamlet Program had been initiated in <TIMEX2 val="1961">1961</TIMEX2>. This joint U.S.-South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps. The aim was to isolate the population from the insurgents, provide education and health care, and strengthen the government's hold over the countryside. The Strategic Hamlets, however, were quickly infiltrated by the guerrillas. The peasants resented being uprooted from their ancestral villages. The government refused to undertake land reform, which left farmers paying high rents to a few wealthy landlords. Corruption dogged the program and intensified opposition. Government officials were targeted for assassination.
On <TIMEX2 val="1962-07-23">23 July 1962</TIMEX2>, fourteen nations, including the People's Republic of China, South Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an agreement promising the neutrality of Laos.

Coup and assassinations

The inept performance of the South Vietnamese army was exemplified by failed actions such as the Battle of Ap Bac on <TIMEX2 val="1963-01-02">2 January 1963</TIMEX2>, in which a small band of Viet Cong beat off a much larger and better equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat. The ARVN were led in that battle by Diem's most trusted General Huynh Van Cao, commander of the IV Corps a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and whose main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups; Cao had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Diem was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned only with fending off coups. As Robert F. Kennedy noted, "Diem wouldn't make even the slightest concessions. He was difficult to reason with..."
Discontent with Diem's policies exploded following the Hue Vesak shootings of majority Buddhists who were protesting against the ban on the Buddhist flag on Vesak, <TIMEX2 val="1963-XX-XX" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the Buddha's birthday</TIMEX2>. This resulted in mass protests against policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents. Diem's elder brother Ngo Dinh Thuc was the Archbishop of Hue and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Diem refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On <TIMEX2 val="1963-08-21">21 August 1963</TIMEX2>, the ARVN Special Forces of Colonel Le Quang Tung, loyal to Diem's younger brother Ngo Dinh Nhu, raided pagodas across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction.
During <TIMEX2 val="1963-SU">the summer of 1963</TIMEX2> U.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a regime change. The United States Department of State was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favoured Diem.
Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Diem's younger brother Ngo Dinh Nhu. Nhu controlled the secret police and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression. As Diem's most powerful adviser, Nhu had become a hated figure in South Vietnam. This was conveyed to the US embassy in Saigon in Cable 243.
The CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Diem. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid. President Diem was overthrown and executed, along with his brother, on <TIMEX2 val="1963-11-02">2 November 1963</TIMEX2>. When he was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that Kennedy "rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face." He had not approved Diem's murder. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them. Ambassador Lodge informed Kennedy that "the prospects <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX2> are for a shorter war".
Following the coup, chaos ensued. Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered <TIMEX2 anchor_val="1963-11-02" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">a period of extreme political instability</TIMEX2>, as one military government toppled another in quick succession. Increasingly, each new regime was viewed as a puppet of the Americans; whatever the failings of Diem, his credentials as a nationalist (as Robert McNamara later reflected) had been impeccable.
U.S military advisers were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese armed forces. They were, however, almost completely ignorant of the political nature of the insurgency. The insurgency was a political power struggle, in which military engagements were not the main goal. The Kennedy administration sought to refocus U.S. efforts on pacification and "winning over the hearts and minds" of the population. The military leadership in Washington, however, was hostile to any role for U.S. advisers other than conventional troop training. General Paul Harkins, the commander of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, confidently predicted victory by <TIMEX2 val="1963-12-25">Christmas 1963</TIMEX2>. The CIA was less optimistic, however, warning that "the Viet Cong by and large retain de facto control of much of the countryside and have steadily increased the overall intensity of the effort".
Paramilitary officers from the CIA's Special Activities Division trained and led Hmoung tribesmen in Laos and into Vietnam. The indigenous forces numbered in the tens of thousands and they conducted direct action missions, led by paramilitary officers, against the Communist Pathet Lao forces and their North Vietnamese supporters. The CIA also ran the Phoenix Program and participation MAC-V SOG (Studies and Observations Group), which was originally named the Special Operations Group, but was changed for cover purposes.

Lyndon B. Johnson expands the war, <TIMEX2 val="1963">1963</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1969">1969</TIMEX2>

Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ), as he took over the presidency after the death of Kennedy, did not consider Vietnam a priority and was more concerned with his "Great Society" and progressive social programs. Presidential aide Jack Valenti recalls, "Vietnam at <TIMEX2 val="1963">the time</TIMEX2> was no bigger than a man's fist on the horizon. We hardly discussed it because it was not worth discussing."
On <TIMEX2 val="1963-11-24">24 November 1963</TIMEX2>, Johnson said, "the battle against communism... must be joined... with strength and determination." The pledge came at <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" anchor_val="1963-11-24" anchor_dir="AS_OF" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">a time when Vietnam was deteriorating, especially in places like the Mekong Delta, because of the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1963-11-24" anchor_dir="BEFORE">recent</TIMEX2> coup against Diem</TIMEX2>.
The military revolutionary council, meeting in lieu of a strong South Vietnamese leader, was made up of 12 members headed by General Minh-whom Stanley Karnow, a journalist on the ground, later recalled as "a model of lethargy." His regime was overthrown in <TIMEX2 val="1964-01">January 1964</TIMEX2> by General Nguyen Khanh. Lodge, frustrated by <TIMEX2 val="1963" mod="END">the end of the year</TIMEX2>, cabled home about Minh: "Will he be strong enough to get on top of things?"
On <TIMEX2 val="1964-08-02">2 August 1964</TIMEX2>, the USS Maddox, on an intelligence mission along North Vietnam's coast, allegedly fired upon and damaged several torpedo boats that had been stalking it in the Gulf of Tonkin. A second attack was reported <TIMEX2 val="1964-08-04">two days later</TIMEX2> on the USS Turner Joy and Maddox in the same area. The circumstances of the attack were murky. Lyndon Johnson commented to Undersecretary of State George Ball that "those sailors out there may have been shooting at flying fish."
The second attack led to retaliatory air strikes, prompted Congress to approve the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, and gave the president power to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without declaring war. In <TIMEX2 val="1964-08">the same month</TIMEX2>, Johnson pledged that he was not "... committing American boys to fighting a war that I think ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to help protect their own land."
An undated NSA publication declassified in <TIMEX2 val="2005">2005</TIMEX2>, however, revealed that there was no attack on <TIMEX2 val="1964-08-04">4 August</TIMEX2>. It had already been called into question long before this. "The Gulf of Tonkin incident", writes Louise Gerdes, "is an oft-cited example of the way in which Johnson misled the American people to gain support for his foreign policy in Vietnam." George C. Herring argues, however, that McNamara and the Pentagon "did not knowingly lie about the alleged attacks, but they were obviously in a mood to retaliate and they seem to have selected from the evidence available to them those parts that confirmed what they wanted to believe."
"From a strength of approximately 5,000 at <TIMEX2 val="1959" mod="START">the start of 1959</TIMEX2> the Viet Cong's ranks grew to about 100,000 at <TIMEX2 val="1964" mod="END">the end of 1964</TIMEX2>...Between <TIMEX2 val="1961">1961</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1964">1964</TIMEX2> the Army's strength rose from about 850,000 to nearly a million men." The numbers for US troops deployed to Vietnam during <TIMEX2 val="P4Y" anchor_val="1961" anchor_dir="STARTING">the same period</TIMEX2> were quite different; 2,000 in <TIMEX2 val="1961">1961</TIMEX2>, rising rapidly to 16,500 in <TIMEX2 val="1964">1964</TIMEX2>.
The National Security Council recommended a three-stage escalation of the bombing of North Vietnam. On <TIMEX2 val="1965-03-02">2 March 1965</TIMEX2>, following an attack on a U.S. Marine barracks at Pleiku, Operation Flaming Dart, Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Arc Light commenced. The bombing campaign, which ultimately lasted <TIMEX2 val="P3Y" anchor_val="1965" anchor_dir="STARTING">three years</TIMEX2>, was intended to force North Vietnam to cease its support for the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF) by threatening to destroy North Vietnam's air defenses and industrial infrastructure. As well, it was aimed at bolstering the morale of the South Vietnamese. Between <TIMEX2 val="1965-03">March 1965</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1968-11">November 1968</TIMEX2>, "Rolling Thunder" deluged the north with a million tons of missiles, rockets and bombs.
Bombing was not restricted to North Vietnam. Other aerial campaigns, such as Operation Commando Hunt, targeted different parts of the NLF and Vietnam People's Army (VPA) infrastructure. These included the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which ran through Laos and Cambodia. The objective of forcing North Vietnam to stop its support for the NLF, however, was never reached. As one officer noted "this is a political war and it calls for discriminate killing. The best weapon... would be a knife... The worst is an airplane." The Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Curtis LeMay, however, had long advocated saturation bombing in Vietnam and wrote of the Communists that "we're going to bomb them back into the Stone Age".

Escalation and ground war

Escalation of the Vietnam War officially started on <TIMEX2 val="1965-01-31TMO">the morning of 31 January 1965</TIMEX2>, when orders were cut and issued to mobilize the 18th Tactical Fighter Wing from Okinawa to Da Nang Air Force Base (AFB). A red alert alarm to scramble was sounded at Kadena AFB at <TIMEX2 val="1965-01-31T03:00">3:00 a.m.</TIMEX2> F-105s, pilots, and support were deployed from Okinawa and landed in Vietnam <TIMEX2 val="1965-01-31TAF">that afternoon</TIMEX2> to join up with other smaller units who had already arrived <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1965-01-31" anchor_dir="BEFORE" comment="TIMEX2 p. 26">weeks earlier</TIMEX2>. Preparations were under way for the first step of Operation Flaming Dart. The mission of Operation Flaming Dart, to cross the Seventeenth Parallel into North Vietnam, had already been planned and was in place before the NLF attack on Pleiku airbase on <TIMEX2 val="1965-02-06">6 February</TIMEX2>.
On <TIMEX2 val="1965-02-07">7 February</TIMEX2>, forty-nine F-105 Thunderchiefs flew out of Danang AFB to targets located in North Vietnam. <TIMEX2 val="FUTURE_REF" anchor_val="1965-02-07" anchor_dir="AFTER">From <TIMEX2 val="1965-02-07">this day</TIMEX2> forward</TIMEX2> the war was no longer confined to South Vietnam. It took <TIMEX2 val="PT1H" mod="LESS_THAN">almost an hour</TIMEX2> to get all forty nine of the F-105's in the air. On <TIMEX2 val="1965-02-07TMO">that morning</TIMEX2>, the continuous loud roar of the F-105 engines going down the runway, one following another, was described by the ground crew as a "rolling thunder".
After several attacks upon them, it was decided that U.S. Air Force bases needed more protection. The South Vietnamese military seemed incapable of providing security. On <TIMEX2 val="1965-03-08">8 March 1965</TIMEX2>, 3,500 United States Marines were dispatched to South Vietnam. This marked the beginning of the American ground war. U.S. public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment. Public opinion, however, was based on the premise that Vietnam was part of a global struggle against communism.
In a statement similar to that made to the French <TIMEX2 val="194" mod="ON_OR_AFTER">almost two decades earlier</TIMEX2>, Ho Chi Minh warned that if the Americans "want to make war for <TIMEX2 val="P20Y">twenty years</TIMEX2> then we shall make war for <TIMEX2 val="P20Y">twenty years</TIMEX2>. If they want to make peace, we shall make peace and invite them to <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XXTAF">afternoon</TIMEX2> tea." As <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1965-02-07" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> First Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co has noted, the primary goal of the war was to reunify Vietnam and secure its independence. The policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) was not to topple other non-communist governments in South East Asia.
The Marines' assignment was defensive. The initial deployment of 3,500 in <TIMEX2 val="1965-03">March</TIMEX2> was increased to nearly 200,000 by <TIMEX2 val="1965-12">December</TIMEX2>. The U.S. military had long been schooled in offensive warfare. Regardless of political policies, U.S. commanders were institutionally and psychologically unsuited to a defensive mission. In <TIMEX2 val="1965-05">May</TIMEX2>, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces suffered heavy losses at the Battle of Binh Gia. They were again defeated in <TIMEX2 val="1965-06">June</TIMEX2>, at the Battle of Dong Xoai.
Desertion rates were increasing, and morale plummeted. General William Westmoreland informed Admiral Grant Sharp, commander of U.S. Pacific forces, that the situation was critical. He said, "I am convinced that U.S. troops with their energy, mobility, and firepower can successfully take the fight to the NLF [National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]."
With this recommendation, Westmoreland was advocating an aggressive departure from America's defensive posture and the sidelining of the South Vietnamese. By ignoring ARVN units, the U.S. commitment became open-ended. Westmoreland outlined a three-point plan to win the war:
"Phase 1. Commitment of U.S. (and other free world) forces necessary to halt the losing trend by <TIMEX2 val="1965" mod="END">the end of 1965</TIMEX2>.
Phase 2. U.S. and allied forces mount major offensive actions to seize the initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy forces. This phase would be concluded when the enemy had been worn down, thrown on the defensive, and driven back from major populated areas.
Phase 3. If the enemy persisted, <TIMEX2 comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">a period of <TIMEX2 val="P12M">twelve</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="P18M">eighteen months</TIMEX2> following Phase 2</TIMEX2> would be required for the final destruction of enemy forces remaining in remote base areas."
The plan was approved by Johnson and marked a profound departure from the previous administration's insistence that the government of South Vietnam was responsible for defeating the guerrillas. Westmoreland predicted victory by <TIMEX2 val="1967" mod="END">the end of 1967</TIMEX2>. Johnson did not, however, communicate this change in strategy to the media. Instead he emphasized continuity. The change in U.S. policy depended on matching the North Vietnamese and the NLF in a contest of attrition and morale. The opponents were locked in a cycle of escalation. The idea that the government of South Vietnam could manage its own affairs was shelved.
It is widely held that the average U.S. serviceman was <TIMEX2 val="P19Y">nineteen years old</TIMEX2>, as evidenced by the casual reference in a pop song ("19" by Paul Hardcastle); the figure is cited by Lt. Col. Dave Grossman ret. of the Killology Research Group in his <TIMEX2 val="1995">1995</TIMEX2> book On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society (p. 265). However, it is disputed by the Vietnam Helicopter Flight Crew Network Website, which claims the average age of MOS 11B personnel was <TIMEX2 val="P22Y">22</TIMEX2>. This compares with <TIMEX2 val="P26Y">26 years of age</TIMEX2> for those who participated in World War II. Soldiers served a <TIMEX2 val="P1Y">one-year</TIMEX2> tour of duty. The average age of the US military men who died in Vietnam was <TIMEX2 val="P22.8Y">22.8 years old</TIMEX2>.
The <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING">one-year</TIMEX2> tour of duty deprived units of experienced leadership. As one observer noted "we were not in Vietnam for <TIMEX2 val="P10Y">10 years</TIMEX2>, but for <TIMEX2 val="P1Y">one year</TIMEX2> 10 times." As a result, training programs were shortened. Some NCOs were referred to as "Shake 'N' Bake" to highlight their accelerated training. Unlike soldiers in World War II and Korea, there were no secure rear areas in which to get rest and relaxation (R'n'R).
One unidentified soldier said to United Press International that there was nothing to do in Vietnam and therefore many of the men smoked marijuana. He said, "One of the reasons I guess -- one of the biggest reasons that a lot of GIs do get high over here is there is nothing to do; this place is really a drag, its a bore over here. Like <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF">right now</TIMEX2> sitting around here, we are getting loaded. Whereas, it doesn't really get you messed up, that's I guess the main reason why we smoke it."
South Vietnam was inundated with manufactured goods. As Stanley Karnow writes, "the main PX, located in the Saigon suburb of Cholon, was only slightly smaller than the New York Bloomingdale's..." The American buildup transformed the economy and had a profound impact on South Vietnamese society. A huge surge in corruption was witnessed.
Washington encouraged its SEATO allies to contribute troops. Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and the Philippines all agreed to send troops. Major allies, however, notably NATO nations, Canada and the United Kingdom, declined Washington's troop requests. The U.S. and its allies mounted complex operations, such as operations Masher, Attleboro, Cedar Falls, and Junction City. However, the communist insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated great tactical flexibility.
Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilize somewhat with the coming to power of Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky and President Nguyen Van Thieu in <TIMEX2 val="1967">1967</TIMEX2>. Thieu, mistrustful and indecisive, remained president until <TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2>. This ended a long series of military juntas that had begun with Diem's assassination. The relative calm allowed the ARVN to collaborate more effectively with its allies and become a better fighting force.
The Johnson administration employed a "policy of minimum candor" in its dealings with the media. Military information officers sought to manage media coverage by emphasizing stories which portrayed progress in the war. Over time, this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements. As the media's coverage of the war and that of the Pentagon diverged, a so-called credibility gap developed.
In <TIMEX2 val="1967-10">October 1967</TIMEX2> a large anti-war demonstration was held on the steps of the Pentagon. Of the thousands of protesters, over 680 were arrested. Some protesters chanted phrases like, "Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh! The NLF is going to win!" and "Hey, hey, LBJ! How many boys did you kill <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX">today</TIMEX2>?"

Tet Offensive

Having lured General Westmoreland's forces into the hinterland at Khe Sanh in Quang Tri Province, in <TIMEX2 val="1968-01">January 1968</TIMEX2>, the NVA and NLF broke the truce that had traditionally accompanied the <TIMEX2>Tết (Lunar New Year) holiday</TIMEX2>. They launched the surprise Tet Offensive in the hope of sparking a national uprising. Over 100 cities were attacked, with assaults on General Westmoreland's headquarters and the U.S. embassy in Saigon.
Although the U.S. and South Vietnamese were initially taken aback by the scale of the urban offensive, they responded quickly and effectively, decimating the ranks of the NLF. In the <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1968-01" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> capital city of Huế, the combined NLF and NVA troops captured the Imperial Citadel and much of the city, which led to the Battle of Hue. Throughout the offensive, the American forces employed massive firepower; in Hue where the battle was the fiercest, that firepower left 80% of the city in ruins. During the interim between the capture of the Citadel and end of the "Battle of Hue", the communist insurgent occupying forces massacred several thousand unarmed Hue civilians (estimates vary up to a high of 6,000). After the war, North Vietnamese officials acknowledged that the Tet Offensive had, indeed, caused grave damage to NLF forces. But the offensive had another, unintended consequence.
General Westmoreland had become the public face of the war. He was featured on the cover of Time magazine three times and was named <TIMEX2 val="1965">1965</TIMEX2>'s Man of <TIMEX2 val="1965">the Year</TIMEX2>. Time described him as "the sinewy personification of the American fighting man... (who) directed the historic buildup, drew up the battle plans, and infused the... men under him with his own idealistic view of U.S. aims and responsibilities."
In <TIMEX2 val="1967-11">November 1967</TIMEX2> Westmoreland spearheaded a public relations drive for the Johnson administration to bolster flagging public support. In a speech before the National Press Club he said that a point in the war had been reached "where the end comes into view." Thus, the public was shocked and confused when Westmoreland's predictions were trumped by Tet. The American media, which had been largely supportive of U.S. efforts, rounded on the Johnson administration for what had become an increasing credibility gap. Despite its military failure, the Tet Offensive became a political victory and ended the career of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who declined to run for re-election. Johnson's approval rating slumped from 48 to 36 percent.
As James Witz noted, Tet "contradicted the claims of progress... made by the Johnson administration and the military." The Tet Offensive was the turning point in America's involvement in the Vietnam War. It had a profound impact on domestic support for the conflict. The offensive constituted an intelligence failure on the scale of Pearl Harbor. Journalist Peter Arnett quoted an unnamed officer, saying of Ben Tre (laid to rubble by US firepower) that "it became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it" (though the authenticity of this quote is disputed). According to one source, this phrase was said by Maj. Booris of 9th Infantry Division.
Westmoreland became Chief of Staff of the Army in <TIMEX2 val="1968-03">March</TIMEX2>, just as all resistance was finally subdued. The move was technically a promotion. However, his position had become untenable because of the offensive and because his request for 200,000 additional troops had been leaked to the media. Westmoreland was succeeded by his deputy Creighton Abrams, a commander less inclined to public media pronouncements.
On <TIMEX2 val="1968-05-10">10 May 1968</TIMEX2>, despite low expectations, peace talks began between the U.S. and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Negotiations stagnated for <TIMEX2 val="P5M" anchor_val="1968-05" anchor_dir="STARTING">five months</TIMEX2>, until Johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of North Vietnam. The Democratic candidate, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, was running against Republican <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1968-10" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> vice president Richard Nixon. Through an intermediary, Anna Chennault, Nixon advised Saigon to refuse to participate in the talks until after elections, claiming that he would give them a better deal once elected. Thieu obliged, leaving almost no progress made by <TIMEX2 comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the time Johnson left office</TIMEX2>.
As historian Robert Dallek writes, "Lyndon Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam divided Americans into warring camps... cost 30,000 American lives by <TIMEX2 comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the time he left office</TIMEX2>, (and) destroyed Johnson's presidency..." His refusal to send more U.S. troops to Vietnam was seen as Johnson's admission that the war was lost. It can be seen that the refusal was a tacit admission that the war could not be won by escalation, at least not at a cost acceptable to the American people. As Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara noted, "the dangerous illusion of victory by the United States was therefore dead."

Vietnamization, <TIMEX2 val="1969">1969</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1972">1972</TIMEX2>

Nixon Doctrine / Vietnamization

Severe communist losses during the Tet Offensive allowed U.S. President Richard M. Nixon to begin troop withdrawals. His plan, called the Nixon Doctrine, was to build up the ARVN, so that they could take over the defense of South Vietnam. The policy became known as "Vietnamization". Vietnamization had much in common with the policies of the Kennedy administration. One important difference, however, remained. While Kennedy insisted that the South Vietnamese fight the war themselves, he attempted to limit the scope of the conflict.
Nixon said in an announcement, "I am <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XXTNI">tonight</TIMEX2> announcing plans for the withdrawal of an additional 150,000 American troops to be completed during <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-SP">the spring of next year</TIMEX2>. This will bring a total reduction of 265,500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below the level that existed when we took office <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX">15 months ago</TIMEX2>."
Nixon also pursued negotiations. Theater commander Creighton Abrams shifted to smaller operations, aimed at communist logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN. Nixon also began to pursue détente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with the People's Republic of China. This policy helped to decrease global tensions. Détente led to nuclear arms reduction on the part of both superpowers. But Nixon was disappointed that the PRC and the Soviet Union continued to supply the North Vietnamese with aid. In <TIMEX2 val="1969-09">September 1969</TIMEX2>, Ho Chi Minh died at age <TIMEX2 val="P79Y" anchor_val="1890" anchor_dir="STARTING">seventy-nine</TIMEX2>.
The anti-war movement was gaining strength in the United States. Nixon appealed to the "silent majority" of Americans to support the war. But revelations of the My Lai Massacre, in which a U.S. Army platoon went on a rampage and raped and killed civilians, and the <TIMEX2 val="1969">1969</TIMEX2> "Green Beret Affair" where eight Special Forces soldiers, including the 5th Special Forces Group Commander were arrested for the murder of a suspected double agent provoked national and international outrage.
The civilian cost of the war was again questioned when the U.S. concluded operation Speedy Express with a claimed bodycount of 10,889 Communist guerillas with only 40 U.S. losses; Kevin Buckley writing in Newsweek estimated that perhaps 5,000 of the Vietnamese dead were civilians.
Beginning in <TIMEX2 val="1970" mod="START">1970</TIMEX2> American troops were being taken away from border areas where much more killing took place and instead put along the coast and interior which is one reason why casualties in <TIMEX2 val="1970">1970</TIMEX2> were less than half of <TIMEX2 val="1969">1969</TIMEX2>'s totals.

Operation Menu: the secret bombing of Cambodia and Laos

Prince Norodom Sihanouk had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since <TIMEX2 val="1955">1955</TIMEX2>, but the communists used Cambodian soil as a base and Sihanouk tolerated their presence, because he wished to avoid being drawn into a wider regional conflict. Under pressure from Washington, however, he changed this policy in <TIMEX2 val="1969">1969</TIMEX2>. The Vietnamese communists were no longer welcome. President Nixon took the opportunity to launch a massive secret bombing campaign, called Operation Menu, against their sanctuaries along the Cambodia/Vietnam border.
This violated a long succession of pronouncements from Washington supporting Cambodian neutrality. Richard Nixon wrote to Prince Sihanouk in <TIMEX2 val="1969-04">April 1969</TIMEX2> assuring him that the United States respected "the sovereignty, neutrality and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia..." In <TIMEX2 val="1970">1970</TIMEX2>, Prince Sihanouk was deposed by his pro-American prime minister Lon Nol. The country's borders were closed, and the U.S. and ARVN launched incursions into Cambodia to attack VPA/NLF bases and buy time for South Vietnam.
The invasion of Cambodia sparked nationwide U.S. protests. Four students were killed by National Guardsmen at Kent State University during a protest in Ohio, which provoked public outrage in the United States. The reaction to the incident by the Nixon administration was seen as callous and indifferent, providing additional impetus for the anti-war movement.
In <TIMEX2 val="1971">1971</TIMEX2> the Pentagon Papers were leaked to The New York Times. The top-secret history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, commissioned by the Department of Defense, detailed a long series of public deceptions. The Supreme Court ruled that its publication was legal.
The ARVN launched Operation Lam Son 719 in <TIMEX2 val="1971-02">February 1971</TIMEX2>, aimed at cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos. The ostensibly neutral Laos had long been the scene of a Secret War. After meeting resistance, ARVN forces retreated in a confused rout. They fled along roads littered with their own dead. When they ran out of fuel, soldiers abandoned their vehicles and attempted to barge their way on to American helicopters sent to evacuate the wounded. Many ARVN soldiers clung to helicopter skids in a desperate attempt to save themselves. U.S. aircraft had to destroy abandoned equipment, including tanks, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Half of the invading ARVN troops were either captured or killed. The operation was a fiasco and represented a clear failure of Vietnamization. As Karnow noted "the blunders were monumental... The (South Vietnamese) government's top officers had been tutored by the Americans for <TIMEX2 val="P10Y">ten</TIMEX2> or <TIMEX2 val="P15Y">fifteen years</TIMEX2>, many at training schools in the United States, yet they had learned little."
In <TIMEX2 val="1971">1971</TIMEX2> Australia and New Zealand withdrew their soldiers. The U.S. troop count was further reduced to 196,700, with a deadline to remove another 45,000 troops by <TIMEX2 val="1972-02">February 1972</TIMEX2>. As peace protests spread across the United States, disillusionment grew in the ranks. Drug use increased, race relations grew tense and the number of soldiers disobeying officers rose. Fragging, or the murder of unpopular officers with fragmentation grenades, increased.
Vietnamization was again tested by the <TIMEX2 val="1972-XX">Easter</TIMEX2> Offensive of <TIMEX2 val="1972">1972</TIMEX2>, a massive conventional invasion of South Vietnam. The VPA and NLF quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half. U.S. troop withdrawals continued. But American airpower came to the rescue with Operation Linebacker, and the offensive was halted. However, it became clear that without American airpower South Vietnam could not survive. The last remaining American ground troops were withdrawn in <TIMEX2 val="1972-08">August</TIMEX2>.

<TIMEX2 val="1972">1972</TIMEX2> election and Paris Peace Accords

The war was the central issue of the <TIMEX2 val="1972">1972</TIMEX2> presidential election. Nixon's opponent, George McGovern, campaigned on a platform of withdrawal from Vietnam. Nixon's National Security Adviser, Henry Kissinger, continued secret negotiations with North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho. In <TIMEX2 val="1972-10">October 1972</TIMEX2>, they reached an agreement.
However, South Vietnamese President Thieu demanded massive changes to the peace accord. When North Vietnam went public with the agreement's details, the Nixon administration claimed that the North was attempting to embarrass the President. The negotiations became deadlocked. Hanoi demanded new changes.
To show his support for South Vietnam and force Hanoi back to the negotiating table, Nixon ordered Operation Linebacker II, a massive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong. The offensive destroyed much of the remaining economic and industrial capacity of North Vietnam. Simultaneously Nixon pressured Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement, threatening to conclude a bilateral peace deal and cut off American aid.
On <TIMEX2 val="1973-01-15">15 January 1973</TIMEX2>, Nixon announced the suspension of offensive action against North Vietnam. The Paris Peace Accords on "Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam" were signed on <TIMEX2 val="1973-01-27">27 January 1973</TIMEX2>, officially ending direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. A cease-fire was declared across North and South Vietnam. U.S. POWs were released. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the Geneva Conference of <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2>, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated <TIMEX2 val="P60D">a sixty-day period</TIMEX2> for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces. "This article," noted Peter Church, "proved... to be the only one of the Paris Agreements which was fully carried out."

Opposition to the Vietnam War: <TIMEX2 val="1962">1962</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2>

Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. One reason given for the withdrawal is that it would contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and thus less human bloodshed. Another, contrasting reason was that the Vietnamese should work out their problems independent of foreign influence.
Early opposition to America's involvement in Vietnam was centered around the Geneva conference of <TIMEX2 val="1954">1954</TIMEX2> and its mandate that elections be held to unite the country. America's refusal to sign the Accords, and their support of Diem, was considered to be thwarting the very democracy that America claimed to be supporting. John Kennedy, while Senator, opposed involvement in Viet Nam.
Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, imperialism and colonialism and, for those involved with the New Left, capitalism itself, such as the Catholic Worker Movement. Others, such as Stephen Spiro opposed the war based on the theory of Just War.
Some critics of U.S. withdrawal predicted that it would not contribute to peace but rather vastly increased bloodshed. These critics advocated U.S. forces remain until all threats from the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army had been eliminated.
Advocates of U.S. withdrawal were generally known as "doves", and they called their opponents "hawks", following nomenclature dating back to the War of <TIMEX2 val="1812">1812</TIMEX2>. This language has dated little in <TIMEX2 val="PXY" anchor_val="1812" anchor_dir="STARTING">the intervening years</TIMEX2>; it is still used.
High-profile opposition to the Vietnam war turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion against the war. The protests gained momentum from the Civil Rights Movement that had organized to oppose segregation laws, which had laid a foundation of theory and infrastructure on which the anti-war movement grew. Protests were fueled by a growing network of independently published newspapers (known as "underground papers") and the timely advent of large venue rock'n'roll festivals such as Woodstock and Grateful Dead shows, attracting younger people in search of generational togetherness. On <TIMEX2 val="1969-10-15">15 October, 1969</TIMEX2>, the Vietnam Moratorium peace demonstration was held in Washington D.C. and other US cities. Millions of Americans, throughout the country, participated.
The fatal shooting of four anti-war protesters at Kent State University cemented the resolve of many protesters. The Kent State killings saw campuses erupt all across the country; in <TIMEX2 val="1970-05">May 1970</TIMEX2> most universities were strike-bound, for example at Wayne State University. <TIMEX2 val="196" mod="END">The late 1960s</TIMEX2> in the U.S. became a time of youth rebellion, mass gatherings and riots, many of which began in response to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but which ignited in an atmosphere of open opposition to a wartime government.
Provocative actions by police and by protesters turned anti-war demonstrations in Chicago at the <TIMEX2 val="1968">1968</TIMEX2> Democratic National Convention into a riot. Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley brought to bear 23,000 police and National Guardsman upon 10,000 protestors. Explosive news reports of American military abuses, such as the <TIMEX2 val="1968">1968</TIMEX2> My Lai Massacre, brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement.
Veterans of the Vietnam War returned home to join the movement, including John Kerry, who spearheaded Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testified before Congress in televised hearings.
Anti-war protests ended with the final withdrawal of troops after the Paris Peace Accords were signed in <TIMEX2 val="1973">1973</TIMEX2>. Momentum from the protest organizations became a main force for the growth of an environmental movement in the United States. South Vietnam was left to defend itself alone when the fighting resumed. Many South Vietnamese fled to the United States in one of the largest war refugee migrations in history. There was no peace movement to protest the renewed bloodshed, and little media coverage. Saigon surrendered to the North in <TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2>; Laos and Cambodia were overrun by Communist troops that same <TIMEX2 val="1975-SP">spring</TIMEX2>.

Exit of the Americans: <TIMEX2 val="1973">1973</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2>

The U.S. began drastically reducing their troop support in South Vietnam during <TIMEX2 val="PXY" anchor_val="1972" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the final years of "Vietnamization</TIMEX2>". Many U.S. troops were removed from the region, and on <TIMEX2 val="1971-03-05">5 March 1971</TIMEX2>, the U.S. returned the 5th Special Forces Group, which was the first American unit deployed to South Vietnam, to its <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1971-03-05" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
Under the Paris Peace Accord, between North Vietnamese Foreign Minister Lê Ðức Thọ and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and reluctantly signed by South Vietnamese President Thiệu, U.S. military forces withdrew from South Vietnam and prisoners were exchanged. North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying communist troops in the South, but only to the extent of replacing materials that were consumed. <TIMEX2 val="1971-XX-XX" anchor_val="1971-03-05" anchor_dir="AFTER">Later that year</TIMEX2> the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Kissinger and Thọ, but the Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying that a true peace did not yet exist.
The communist leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favor their side. But Saigon, bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the Vietcong. The communists responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in Hanoi in <TIMEX2 val="1973-03">March 1973</TIMEX2>, according to the memoirs of Trần Văn Trà.
As the Vietcong's top commander, Trà participated in several of these meetings. With U.S. bombings suspended, work on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and other logistical structures could proceed unimpeded. Logistics would be upgraded until the North was in a position to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for the <TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1976">1976</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2>dry season</TIMEX2>. Trà calculated that <TIMEX2 val="XXXX-XX-XX">this date</TIMEX2> would be Hanoi's last opportunity to strike before Saigon's army could be fully trained. A three-thousand-mile long oil pipeline would be built from North Vietnam to Vietcong headquarters in Loc Ninh, about 75 miles (121 km) northwest of Saigon.
Although McGovern himself was not elected U.S. president, the <TIMEX2 val="1972-11">November 1972</TIMEX2> election did return a Democratic majority to both houses of Congress under McGovern's "Come home America" campaign theme. On <TIMEX2 val="1973-03-15">15 March 1973</TIMEX2>, U.S. President Richard Nixon implied that the U.S. would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire. Public and congressional reaction to Nixon's trial balloon was unfavorable and in <TIMEX2 val="1973-04">April</TIMEX2> Nixon appointed Graham Martin as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. Martin was a second stringer compared to previous U.S. ambassadors and his appointment was an early signal that Washington had given up on Vietnam. During his confirmation hearings in <TIMEX2 val="1973-06">June 1973</TIMEX2>, Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. On <TIMEX2 val="1973-06-04">4 June 1973</TIMEX2>, the U.S. Senate passed the Case-Church Amendment to prohibit such intervention.
The oil price shock of <TIMEX2 val="1973-10">October 1973</TIMEX2> caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. The Vietcong resumed offensive operations when <TIMEX2>dry season</TIMEX2> began and by <TIMEX2 val="1974-01">January 1974</TIMEX2> it had recaptured the territory it lost during the previous <TIMEX2>dry season</TIMEX2>. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thiệu announced on <TIMEX2 val="1974-01-04">4 January</TIMEX2> that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There had been over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during <TIMEX2 val="P343D" anchor_val="1973-01-27" anchor_dir="STARTING" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the ceasefire period</TIMEX2>.
Gerald Ford took over as U.S. president on <TIMEX2 val="1974-08-09">9 August 1974</TIMEX2> after President Nixon resigned due to the Watergate scandal. <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" anchor_val="1974-08-09" anchor_dir="AS_OF">At this time</TIMEX2>, Congress cut financial aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion <TIMEX2 val="P1Y" set="YES">a year</TIMEX2> to $700 million. The U.S. midterm elections in <TIMEX2 val="1974">1974</TIMEX2> brought in a new Congress dominated by Democrats who were even more determined to confront the president on the war. Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through <TIMEX2 val="1975">1975</TIMEX2> and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in <TIMEX2 val="1976">1976</TIMEX2>.
The success of the <TIMEX2 val="1973">1973</TIMEX2>-<TIMEX2 val="1974">1974</TIMEX2> <TIMEX2>dry season</TIMEX2> offensive inspired Trà to return to Hanoi in <TIMEX2 val="1974-10">October 1974</TIMEX2> and plead for a larger offensive in the next <TIMEX2>dry season</TIMEX2>. This time, Trà could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops, a vast change from <TIMEX2 val="PXD">the days</TIMEX2> was Ho Chi Minh Trail was a dangerous mountain trek. Giáp, the North Vietnamese defense minister, was reluctant to approve Trà's plan. A larger offensive might provoke a U.S. reaction and interfere with the big push planned for <TIMEX2 val="1976">1976</TIMEX2>. Trà appealed over Giáp's head to first secretary Lê Duẩn, who approved of the operation.
Trà's plan called for a limited offensive from Cambodia into Phuoc Long Province. The strike was designed to solve local logistical problems, gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces, and determine whether the U.S. would return to the fray.
On <TIMEX2 val="1974-12-13">13 December 1974</TIMEX2>, North Vietnamese forces attacked Route 14 in Phuoc Long Province. Phuoc Binh, the provincial capital, fell on <TIMEX2 val="1975-01-06">6 January 1975</TIMEX2>. Ford desperately asked Congress for funds to assist and re-supply the South before it was overrun. Congress refused. The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American response left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized and corruption grew rampant.
The speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy. It was decided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to General Văn Tiến Dũng and that Pleiku should be seized, if possible. Before he left for the South, Dũng was addressed by Lê Duẩn: "Never have we had military and political conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF">now</TIMEX2>."
At <TIMEX2 val="1975" mod="START">the start of 1975</TIMEX2> the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery and twice the number of tanks and armoured cars as the opposition. They also had 1,400 aircraft and a two-to-one numerical superiority in combat troops over their Communist enemies. Nevertheless, they faced a well-organized, highly determined and well-funded North Vietnam. Much of the North's material and financial support came from the communist bloc. Within South Vietnam, there was increasing chaos. Their abandonment by the American military had compromised an economy dependent on U.S. financial support and the presence of a large number of U.S. troops. South Vietnam suffered from the global recession which followed the Arab oil embargo.

Campaign 275

On <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-10">10 March 1975</TIMEX2>, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery. The target was Ban Me Thuot, in Daklak Province. If the town could be taken, the provincial capital of Pleiku and the road to the coast would be exposed for a planned campaign in <TIMEX2 val="1976">1976</TIMEX2>. The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed on <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-11">11 March</TIMEX2>. Once again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success. Dung <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" anchor_val="1975-03-10" anchor_dir="AS_OF">now</TIMEX2> urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to Kontum. He argued that with <TIMEX2 val="P2M" anchor_val="1975-03-11" anchor_dir="AFTER" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">two months of good weather remaining until the onset of the monsoon</TIMEX2>, it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation.
President Nguyen Van Thieu, a <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1975-03-11" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> general, was fearful that his forces would be cut off in the north by the attacking communists; Thieu ordered a retreat. The president declared this to be a "lighten the top and keep the bottom" strategy. But in what appeared to be a repeat of Operation Lam Son 719, the withdrawal soon turned into a bloody rout. While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted to flee, isolated units fought desperately. ARVN General Phu abandoned Pleiku and Kontum and retreated toward the coast, in what became known as the "column of tears".
As the ARVN tried to disengage from the enemy, refugees mixed in with the line of retreat. The poor condition of roads and bridges, damaged by <TIMEX2 val="PXY" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">years of conflict and neglect</TIMEX2>, slowed Phu's column. As the North Vietnamese forces approached, panic set in. Often abandoned by the officers, the soldiers and civilians were shelled incessantly. The retreat degenerated into a desperate scramble for the coast. By <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-01">1 April</TIMEX2> the "column of tears" was all but annihilated. It marked one of the poorest examples of a strategic withdrawal in modern military history.
On <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-20">20 March</TIMEX2>, Thieu reversed himself and ordered Hue, Vietnam's third-largest city, be held at all costs. Thieu's contradictory orders confused and demoralized his officer corps. As the North Vietnamese launched their attack, panic set in, and ARVN resistance withered. On <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-22">22 March</TIMEX2>, the VPA opened the siege of Hue. Civilians flooded the airport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape. Some even swam out to sea to reach boats and barges anchored offshore. In the confusion, routed ARVN soldiers fired on civilians to make way for their retreat.
On <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-31">31 March</TIMEX2>, after a <TIMEX2 val="P3D" anchor_val="1975-03-31" anchor_dir="ENDING">three-day</TIMEX2> battle, Hue fell. As resistance in Hue collapsed, North Vietnamese rockets rained down on Da Nang and its airport. By <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-28">28 March</TIMEX2>, 35,000 VPA troops were poised to attack the suburbs. By <TIMEX2 val="1975-03-30">30 March</TIMEX2>, 100,000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the VPA marched victoriously through Da Nang. With the fall of the city, the defense of the Central Highlands and Northern provinces came to an end.

Final North Vietnamese offensive

With the northern half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered General Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon. The operational plan for the Ho Chi Minh Campaign called for the capture of Saigon before <TIMEX2 val="1975-05-01">1 May</TIMEX2>. Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital. Northern forces, their morale boosted by their <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF">recent</TIMEX2> victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh, and Da Lat.
On <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-07">7 April</TIMEX2>, three North Vietnamese divisions attacked Xuan Loc, 40 miles (64 km) east of Saigon. The North Vietnamese met fierce resistance at Xuan Loc from the ARVN 18th Division. For <TIMEX2 val="P2W" anchor_val="1975-04-07" anchor_dir="STARTING">two bloody weeks</TIMEX2>, severe fighting raged as the ARVN defenders made a last stand to try to block the North Vietnamese advance. By <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-21">21 April</TIMEX2>, however, the exhausted garrison surrendered.
An embittered and tearful President Thieu resigned on <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-21">the same day</TIMEX2>, declaring that the United States of America had betrayed South Vietnam. In a scathing attack on the US, he suggested U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement <TIMEX2 val="1973">two years ago</TIMEX2>, promising military aid which then failed to materialise.
"At <TIMEX2 val="1973-01-27" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the time of the peace agreement</TIMEX2> the United States agreed to replace equipment on a one-by-one basis.But the United States did not keep its word. Is an American's word reliable <TIMEX2 val="PRESENT_REF" anchor_val="1975" anchor_dir="AS_OF">these days</TIMEX2>?...The United States did not keep its promise to help us fight for freedom and it was in the same fight that the United States lost 50,000 of its young men."
He left for Taiwan on <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-25">25 April</TIMEX2>, leaving control of the government in the hands of General Duong Van Minh. At <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-25">the same time</TIMEX2>, North Vietnamese tanks had reached Bien Hoa and turned toward Saigon, brushing aside isolated ARVN units along the way.
By <TIMEX2 val="1975-04" mod="END">the end of April</TIMEX2>, the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam had collapsed on all fronts. Thousand of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. On <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-27">27 April</TIMEX2>, 100,000 North Vietnamese troops encircled Saigon. The city was defended by about 30,000 ARVN troops. To hasten a collapse and foment panic, the VPA shelled the airport and forced its closure. With the air exit closed, large numbers of civilians found that they had no way out.

Fall of Saigon

Chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Saigon. Martial law was declared. American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, U.S., and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the U.S. embassy compound. Operation Frequent Wind had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of U.S. Ambassador Graham Martin's belief that Saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached.
Schlesinger announced <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-29TMO">early in the morning of 29 April 1975</TIMEX2> the evacuation from Saigon by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel. Frequent Wind was arguably the largest helicopter evacuation in history. It began on <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-29">29 April</TIMEX2>, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited seats. Martin pleaded with Washington to dispatch $700 million in emergency aid to bolster the regime and help it mobilize fresh military reserves. But American public opinion had soured on this conflict halfway around the world.
In the U.S., South Vietnam was perceived as doomed. President Gerald Ford had given a televised speech on <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-23">23 April</TIMEX2>, declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U.S. aid. Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as North Vietnamese tanks breached defenses on the outskirts of Saigon. The song "White Christmas" was broadcast as the final signal for withdrawal. In <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-30TMO">the early morning hours of 30 April</TIMEX2>, the last U.S. Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds. Many of them had been employed by the Americans and were left to their fate.
On <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-30">30 April 1975</TIMEX2>, VPA troops overcame all resistance, quickly capturing key buildings and installations. A tank crashed through the gates of the Presidential Palace, and at <TIMEX2 val="1975-04-30T11:30">11:30 a.m.</TIMEX2> local time the NLF flag was raised above it. Thieu's successor, President Duong Van Minh, attempted to surrender, but VPA officers informed him that he had nothing left to surrender. Minh then issued his last command, ordering all South Vietnamese troops to lay down their arms.
The Communists had attained their goal: they had toppled the Saigon regime. But the cost of victory was high. In <TIMEX2 val="P1DE" anchor_val="197" anchor_dir="ENDING">the past decade</TIMEX2> alone, one Vietnamese in every ten had been a casualty of war-nearly a million and a half killed, three million wounded.
By war's end, the Vietnamese had been fighting foreign involvement or occupation (primarily by the French, Chinese, Japanese, British, and American governments) for <TIMEX2 val="P116Y" anchor_val="1975" anchor_dir="ENDING">116 years</TIMEX2>.
