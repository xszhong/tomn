<TIMEX2 val="1936">1936</TIMEX2>

Coup leader Sanjurjo was killed in a plane crash on <TIMEX2 val="1936-07-20">20 July</TIMEX2>, leaving an effective command split between Mola in the North and Franco in the South. On <TIMEX2 val="1936-07-21">21 July</TIMEX2>, <TIMEX2 val="1936-07-21" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">the fifth day of the rebellion</TIMEX2>, the Nationalists captured the main Spanish naval base at Ferrol in northwestern Spain. A rebel force under Colonel Beorlegui Canet, sent by General Emilio Mola, undertook the Campaign of Guipúzcoa from <TIMEX2 val="1936-07">July</TIMEX2> to <TIMEX2 val="1936-09">September</TIMEX2>. The capture of Guipúzcoa isolated the Republican provinces in the north. On <TIMEX2 val="1936-09-05">5 September</TIMEX2>, after heavy fighting the force took Irún, closing the French border to the Republicans. On <TIMEX2 val="1936-09-13">13 September</TIMEX2>, the Basques surrendered San Sebastián to the Nationalists, who then advanced toward their capital, Bilbao. The Republican militias on the border of Viscaya halted these forces at <TIMEX2 val="1936-09" mod="END">the end of September</TIMEX2>.
Franco was chosen overall Nationalist commander at a meeting of ranking generals at Salamanca on <TIMEX2 val="1936-09-21">21 September</TIMEX2>. Franco won another victory on <TIMEX2 val="1936-09-27">27 September</TIMEX2> when they relieved the Alcázar at Toledo. A Nationalist garrison under Colonel Moscardo had held the Alcázar in the center of the city since the beginning of the rebellion, resisting thousands of Republican troops who completely surrounded the isolated building. The Republic's inability to take the Alcázar was a serious blow to its prestige in view of its overwhelming numerical superiority in the area. <TIMEX2 val="1936-09-29" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">Two days after relieving the siege</TIMEX2>, Franco proclaimed himself Generalísimo and Caudillo ("chieftain"), while forcibly unifying the various and diverse Falangist, Royalist and other elements within the Nationalist cause.
In <TIMEX2 val="1936-10">October</TIMEX2>, the Francoist troops launched a major offensive toward Madrid, reaching it in <TIMEX2 val="1936-11" mod="START">early November</TIMEX2> and launching a major assault on the city on <TIMEX2 val="1936-11-08">8 November</TIMEX2>. The Republican government was forced to shift from Madrid to Valencia, out of the combat zone, on <TIMEX2 val="1936-11-06">6 November</TIMEX2>. However, the Nationalists' attack on the capital was repulsed in fierce fighting between <TIMEX2 val="1936-11-08">8 November</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1936-11-23">23 November</TIMEX2>. A contributory factor in the successful Republican defense was the arrival of the International Brigades, though only around 3,000 of them participated in the battle. Having failed to take the capital, Franco bombarded it from the air and, in <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" anchor_val="1936-11-23" anchor_dir="AFTER">the following two years</TIMEX2>, mounted several offensives to try to encircle Madrid.

<TIMEX2 val="1937">1937</TIMEX2>

With his ranks swelled by Italian troops and Spanish colonial soldiers from Morocco, Franco made another attempt to capture Madrid in <TIMEX2 val="1937-01">January</TIMEX2> and <TIMEX2 val="1937-02">February 1937</TIMEX2>, but again failed.
On <TIMEX2 val="1937-02-21">21 February</TIMEX2> the League of Nations Non-Intervention Committee ban on foreign national "volunteers" went into effect. The large city of Málaga was taken on <TIMEX2 val="1937-02-08">8 February</TIMEX2>. On <TIMEX2 val="1937-03-07">7 March</TIMEX2>, the German Condor Legion equipped with Heinkel He 51 biplanes arrived in Spain; on <TIMEX2 val="1937-04-26">26 April</TIMEX2> the Legion Bombed the town of Guernica, killing hundreds. <TIMEX2 val="1937-04-28">Two days later</TIMEX2>, Franco's army overran the town.
After the fall of Guernica, the Republican government began to fight back with increasing effectiveness. In <TIMEX2 val="1937-07">July</TIMEX2>, they made a move to recapture Segovia, forcing Franco to pull troops away from the Madrid front to halt their advance. Mola, Franco's second-in-command, was killed on <TIMEX2 val="1937-06-03">3 June</TIMEX2>, and in <TIMEX2 val="1937-07" mod="START">early July</TIMEX2>, despite the fall of Bilbao in <TIMEX2 val="1937-06">June</TIMEX2>, the government launched a strong counter-offensive in the Madrid area, which the Nationalists repulsed with difficulty. The clash was called "Battle of Brunete" after a town in the province of Madrid.
Franco invaded Aragón in <TIMEX2 val="1937-08">August</TIMEX2> and then took the city of Santander. With the surrender of the Republican army in the Basque territory and after <TIMEX2 val="P2M" anchor_val="1937-10" anchor_dir="ENDING" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">two months of bitter fighting in Asturias</TIMEX2> (Gijón finally fell in <TIMEX2 val="1937-10" mod="END">late October</TIMEX2>) Franco had effectively won in the north. At <TIMEX2 val="1937-11" mod="END">the end of November</TIMEX2>, with Franco's troops closing in on Valencia, the government had to move again, this time to Barcelona.

<TIMEX2 val="1938">1938</TIMEX2>

The Battle of Teruel was an important confrontation. The city belonged to the Nationalists at the beginning of the battle, but the Republicans conquered it in <TIMEX2 val="1938-01">January</TIMEX2>. The Francoist troops launched an offensive and recovered the city by <TIMEX2 val="1938-02-22">22 February</TIMEX2>, but in order to do so Franco relied heavily on German and Italian air support and repaid them with extensive mining rights.
On <TIMEX2 val="1938-03-07">7 March</TIMEX2>, the Nationalists launched the Aragon Offensive. By <TIMEX2 val="1938-04-14">14 April</TIMEX2>, they had pushed through to the Mediterranean, cutting the Republican-held portion of Spain in two. The Republican government tried to sue for peace in <TIMEX2 val="1938-05">May</TIMEX2>, but Franco demanded unconditional surrender; the war raged on. In <TIMEX2 val="1938-07">July</TIMEX2>, the Nationalist army pressed southward from Teruel and south along the coast toward the capital of the Republic at Valencia but was halted in heavy fighting along the XYZ Line, a system of fortifications defending Valencia.
The Republican government then launched an all-out campaign to reconnect their territory in the Battle of the Ebro, from <TIMEX2 val="1938-07-24">24 July</TIMEX2> until <TIMEX2 val="1938-11-26">26 November</TIMEX2>. The campaign was unsuccessful, and was undermined by the Franco-British appeasement of Hitler in Munich with the concession of Czechoslovakia. This effectively destroyed Republican morale by ending hope of an anti-fascist alliance with the Western powers. The retreat from the Ebro all but determined the final outcome of the war. <TIMEX2 val="1938-12-24" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">Eight days before <TIMEX2 val="1939-01-01">the new year</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>, Franco threw massive forces into an invasion of Catalonia.

<TIMEX2 val="1939">1939</TIMEX2>

Franco's troops conquered Catalonia in a whirlwind campaign during <TIMEX2 val="P2M" anchor_val="1939-01" anchor_dir="STARTING">the first two months of <TIMEX2 val="1939">1939</TIMEX2></TIMEX2>. Tarragona fell on <TIMEX2 val="1939-01-14">14 January</TIMEX2>, followed by Barcelona on <TIMEX2 val="1939-01-26">26 January</TIMEX2> and Girona on <TIMEX2 val="1939-02-05">5 February</TIMEX2>. <TIMEX2 val="1939-02-10" comment="EC:EVENT-BASED">Five days after the fall of Girona</TIMEX2>, the last resistance in Catalonia was broken.
On <TIMEX2 val="1939-02-27">27 February</TIMEX2>, the United Kingdom and France recognized the Franco regime.
Only Madrid and a few other strongholds remained for the Republican forces. Then, on <TIMEX2 val="1939-03-28">28 March</TIMEX2>, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city, Madrid fell to the Nationalists. <TIMEX2 val="1939-03-29">The next day</TIMEX2>, Valencia, which had held out under their guns for <TIMEX2 val="P2Y" mod="LESS_THAN" anchor_val="1939-03-29" anchor_dir="ENDING">close to two years</TIMEX2>, also surrendered. Franco proclaimed victory in a radio speech aired on <TIMEX2 val="1939-04-01">1 April</TIMEX2>, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered.
After the end of the War, there were harsh reprisals against Franco's <TIMEX2 val="PAST_REF" anchor_val="1939-04-01" anchor_dir="BEFORE">former</TIMEX2> enemies; thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and at least 30,000 executed. Other calculations of these deaths range from 50,000 to 200,000. Many others were put to forced labour, building railways, drying out swamps, digging canals, etc.
Hundreds of thousands of Republicans fled abroad, some 500,000 to France. Refugees were confined in internment camps of the French Third Republic, such as Camp Gurs or Camp Vernet, where 12,000 Republicans were housed in squalid conditions. Of the 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs, the farmers and ordinary people who could not find relations in France were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in Irún. From there they were transferred to the Miranda de Ebro camp for "purification" according to the Law of Political Responsibilities. After the proclamation by Marshal Philippe Pétain of the Vichy regime, the refugees became political prisoners, and the French police attempted to round up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other "undesirables", they were sent to the Drancy internment camp before being deported to Nazi Germany. About 5,000 Spaniards thus died in Mauthausen concentration camp.
After the official end of the war, guerrilla war was waged on an irregular basis well into <TIMEX2 val="195">the 1950s</TIMEX2>, being gradually reduced by military defeats and scant support from the exhausted population. In <TIMEX2 val="1944">1944</TIMEX2>, a group of republican veterans, who also fought in the French resistance against the Nazis, invaded the Val d'Aran in northwest Catalonia, but were defeated after <TIMEX2 val="P10D" anchor_val="1944" anchor_dir="WITHIN">ten days</TIMEX2>.
